What is OOP?

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a way of writing code where we think in terms of real-world objects.

For example:

             Car 🚗

            Student 👨‍🎓

            Phone 📱

In Python, we create these using classes and objects.

(1) Class

A class is like a blueprint or template.

Example:

House design → Class                            Ghar ka naksha → Class

Real house → Object                             Ghar khud → Object

(2) Object
