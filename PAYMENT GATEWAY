What is a Payment Gateway?

A payment gateway is an online service that helps a website or app accept payments from customers.

It works as a bridge between:

Bank

Examples: Razorpay, Stripe, PayPal, Paytm.

What Does a Payment Gateway Do?

Collects payment details from the customer

Sends details securely to the bank

Checks if payment is approved or rejected

How Payment Gateway Works (Step-by-Step)

Step 1: Customer selects product
The customer adds a product to the cart.

Step 2: Customer clicks Checkout

The website backend creates an order using the payment gateway API.

Step 4: Payment page opens
A secure payment page or popup opens.

Step 5: Customer enters payment details
The customer enters UPI, card, or net banking details.

The payment gateway sends the request to the bank.
The bank checks if:

Money is available

Details are correct

Step 7: Bank response
The bank approves or rejects the payment.

Step 8: Result sent to website
The payment gateway sends success or failure response to the website.

If failed, it is marked as “Failed”.
