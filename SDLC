SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.

SDLC is a step-by-step process used to build software from start to end.

The first step is Requirement Gathering.
In this step, we understand what the client or user needs and what the software should do.

The second step is Design.
In this step, we plan how the software will look and how it will work, including UI, database, and system structure.

The third step is Development.
In this step, developers write the actual code for the software.

The fourth step is Testing.
In this step, the software is tested to find and fix bugs and ensure it works correctly.

The fifth step is Deployment.
In this step, the software is released to users or moved to the production environment.

The sixth step is Maintenance.
In this step, bugs are fixed, updates are made, and new features are added after release.

SDLC is important because it helps deliver quality software, reduces errors, and ensures smooth development.

In simple words, SDLC helps teams build software in an organized and efficient way.
